#Bus timetable

-  This exercise is similar to the train exercise we did previously, but we'll redo it in Rails now. Here are some user stories to start out with:

- As a bus system operator, I want to add bus stations, so that I can show where all of the buses will go.
- As a bus system operator, I want to add bus lines, so that I can track which lines go to which stations.
- As a bus rider, I want to view a bus line, so that I can see the stations where it stops.
- As a bus rider, I want to view a bus station, so that I can see which buses come to it.
- There's a many-to-many relationship between stations and lines. I'd suggest calling your join table stops.

- If you get through these first stories, here are a few more for you:

- As a bus system operator, I want to add buses to a line, so that I can assign each physical bus to a particular line.
- As a bus rider, I want to view a bus line and see all of the buses that run on it and what time they arrive at each stop, so that I can pick one that fits my schedule.
- As a bus rider, I want a visual representation of the bus system, so that I can more easily see which lines go where. Hint: Check out D3.js; don't overlook the d3-rails gem.
